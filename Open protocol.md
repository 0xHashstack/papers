## Abstract
The recent resurgence of decentralised **finance**[herafter defi] has enabled millions around the world with better access to capital, & a means for alternative income streams. This surge however paved the way for its own unique set of challenges. Challenges that can be narrowed down to one word, inefficiency. While there has been no dearth in innovation in decentralised finance, the majority of the existing solutions are far from comparable to their centralised counterparts. One such niche, the present day defi struggles with is, Lending. Defi lending in its current state is broken. It serves a niche use-case, and is sub-par in comparison with the centralised services. While the technology to build a much more efficient product is available, unfortunately, it is not implemented yet. We propose Open protocol. An autonomous lending framework with multi-chain interoperability, providing under-collateralized loans upto 1:3 collateral-to-debt ratio[hereafter cdr], at predictive interest & yield rates.
