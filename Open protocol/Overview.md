## Abstract
#
The recent resurgence of decentralised **finance**[herafter defi] has enabled millions around the world **with** better access to capital, & a means for alternative income streams. This surge however paved the way for its own unique set of challenges. Challenges that can be narrowed down to one word, inefficiency. While there has been no dearth in innovation in decentralised finance, the majority of the existing solutions are far from comparable to their centralised counterparts. One such niche, the present day defi struggles with is, Lending. Defi lending in its current state is broken. It serves a niche use-case, and is sub-par in comparison with the centralised services. While the technology to build a much more efficient product is available, unfortunately, it is not implemented yet. We propose Open protocol. An autonomous lending framework with multi-chain interoperability, providing under-collateralized loans upto 1:3 collateral-to-debt ratio[hereafter cdr], at predictive interest & yield rates.

## Benefits of Hashstack’s Open protocol?

A fixed loan is best suited for long-term investors & position traders, who prefer to hold an asset that is expected to perform good, over a period of a month to a year. A position trader can avoid sitting on the  sidelines, by leveraging Hashstack’s fixed loans; to earn yield on otherwise dormant funds. The trader can invest the borrowed funds into another asset most likely to yield better returns in a shorter span. With fixed loans, the borrower enjoys the below benefits.
Free-up the liquidity locked in an asset[for example: Bitcoin, Ethereum] to invest in other assets.

Earn an annualized yield of 15% on the dormant assets[deposited as collateral].
Secure any profits earned through the investment of the borrowed funds, to themselves.

> **Example:** David owns 100 BNB[market price: $500]. David plans to invest in Bitcoin, but not at the expense of BNB. As a solution to this problem, David deposits 100 BNB on Hashstack’s Open protocol as collateral, and borrows $100,000 USDC as fixed loan at a 1:2 cdr. David withdraws the permissible $35,000 USDC. He swaps the remaining loan value of $65,000 USDC to Bitcoin. A month later, Bitcoin appreciates 30% in value, effectively converting David’s $65,000 into $84,500; while his alt coin positions return a 20% return. David swaps bitcoin into USDC to repay 84.5% of his loan. His $35,000 turned into $42,000. Of which he repays $15,500 back effectively closing the loan. All the while, his BNB collateral earned him 15% APY. So, in effect, David ended up earning $26,500 in addition to 1.5% interest on his BNB coins. This is a possibility not seen in any of the existing decentralised financial solutions.

A flexible loan is tailored for the day traders, swing traders & smaller investors. A flexible loan can be deemed as a source of the trading capital. This loan provides an opportunity to the borrower to continue holding a token, while freeing up trading capital to invest in other tokens, yield compound returns. 

Deposits are designed to help a user convert the long-term investment hodl tokens into actively yield compounding secondary income streams, as compared to an alternative of storing on the centralised exchanges, or a wallet. 

A key caveat to note that, the interest accrued on a deposit is reinvested to compound returns for the depositor. This is enabled for only the fixed deposits.


### Overview
1. Open protocol is the lending framework developed by Hashstack.
2. Open protocol facilitates loans upto 300% against the collateral.
3. Similar to traditional financial institutions, Open maintains a predictive interest rate. On Hashstack, a depositor earns 15-18% APY. The interest rates are revised each quarter. Any basis point adjustments are propagated to the apy & apr accrued in the succeeding quarter.

### Glossary
1. Collateral: A token(s) deposited by a borrower as a security deposit in-order to secure a loan.
2. Base token: Primary tokens supported by Hashstack’s lending protocol, Open. These are  AVAX, ETH, BNB, USDC.
3. CDR: Collateral to debt ratio, is the proportion of collateral provided by a borrower against the loan amount. CDR relies on US dollars as a base currency to determine the ratio. For example: A user with the collateral of 100ETH, at a current ETH price of $1,000 can borrow funds of utmost $300,000 in USD value.
4. Depositor aka maker aka creditor: A user who provides liquidity to the Hashstack’s lending ecosystem through deposits. 
5. Borrower aka taker: A user who borrows assets from the Hashstack lending product by providing a collateral in the range of 1:1 to 1:3 collateral to debt proportion.
6. APR: An annual percentage rate (APR) is the annual rate charged on the collateral against the borrowed amount. 
7. APY: An annual percentage yield (APY) is the annualized rate of interest earned against the deposits. APY compounds gains on the interests earned by automatically considering the  interests as additional deposits.
8. Collateral-check: An off-chain verification performed to determine if the borrower has adequate collateral to maintain loan security.
9. LCP: Loan closure period. The time period measured in block time,  between the loan repayment and the collateral release.
