## Abstract
Decentralised finance[hereafter defi] has enabled millions around the world with better access to capital, & a means for alternative income streams. This surge however has paved the way for its own unique set of challenges. Today’s defi is muddled with dynamic inefficiencies. While there has been no dearth in **innovation** in decentralised finance, the majority are far from comparable to their traditional counterparts.
DeFi lending, a critical application of decentralised finance, has been at the forefront of defi revolution with consistent market capture of 56-70%. However, on-chain lending is broken; serving a niche use-case, & is sub-par in comparison with the centralised services. Despite the ready availability of technology, there is a dearth of crypto-native solutions solving the problem of over-collateralisation. An on-chain credit risk oracle while seems a straightforward solution, the inadequacy of onchain financial data deems any form of on-chain credit score unreliable. We propose a middleware solution that solves this problem of over-collateralisation in DeFi lending, while bypassing the need for a credit score. Hashstack’s Open protocol is a money market protocol standard with multi-chain interoperability, providing permissionless, secure, under-collateralized loans upto  3 times the borrower’s collateral.

This is a working draft, and must be treated as such. Over time, the end product has surpassed the the assumptions & hypotheses of the [whitepaper v0.2.7](../Open%20protocol/v0.2/Open%20protocol%20v0.2.7.pdf) in three main areas

#
# Breaking changes v1.0
1. APR switched from fixed to algorithmically determined range bound stable rates.
2. Dividends, secondary rewards layer is removed to de-stress the protocol.
3. Liquidation: Liquidation price formula is updated.
